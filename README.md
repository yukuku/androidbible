Bible translations/versions
---------------------------

This app natively uses *.yes* files for the Bible text. You can create a *.yes* file easily by preparing a plain text file. See <a href="https://alkitab.app/developer">this page for</a> instructions.

You can also convert PalmBible+ PDB files using the built-in converter in the app for your own use. 

Tools for converting PalmBible+ PDB files to *.yet* files, and from *.yet* files to *.yes* files and internal app files, are available at https://goo.gl/3wo5zv.
