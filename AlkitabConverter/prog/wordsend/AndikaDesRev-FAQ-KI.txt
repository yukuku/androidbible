AndikaDesRev-FAQ-KI
===========

Where does the name "Andika" come from?
  Andika (pronounced ahn-DEE-kah) 
  Swahili - spoken widely in southeastern regions of the African continent, among other places. (See http://www.ethnologue.com/)
  Meaning - "Write!"


What characters are included in this release? 
  Andika Design Review covers what we call the Basic Character Set: some 600 of the most commonly-used (in the SIL world) Roman characters.  See http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_technical for the full listing.


What if the character(s) I need to test aren't in this Design Review release?
  As mentioned above, this is a limited version of the font. Work with what is included to see how it looks overall, substituting where necessary from other fonts. Our keenest desire at this time is field input on the existing letterforms. And keep remembering that the release of the Regular font {em:will} have the same global inventory as Doulos SIL and Charis SIL; that is, near-complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode 4.1 for Latin and Cyrillic. In other words, if your glyph is in Doulos, it will ultimately be in Andika.


Will the next release include this global inventory?
  Not yet. The next release will be called Andika Basic, and have the same characters as Design Review, but in their finalized forms. That's why we are seeking your feedback (see http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_feedback) on these letterforms now, to incorporate the necessary changes *before* we draw the next 1,800 letters, many of which will be based on one or another of these Basic ones.


What are all the stages of release for the Andika fonts?
  Andika Design Review (where we are currently)
  Andika Basic
  Andika Regular
  Andika Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic
  It's a long process, if you haven't guessed by now.  :-)


Why is the line spacing so much looser than other fonts, such as Times New Roman or Gentium?
  Our SIL Unicode Roman fonts include characters with multiple stacked diacritics that need a much looser line spacing (for example, U+1EB4 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH BREVE AND TILDE). We cannot make the line spacing tighter without experiencing “clipping” of those characters. You may be able to overcome this by adjusting the line spacing in the application. For example, in Microsoft Word select Format / Paragraph and set the line spacing to use the Exactly setting and choose a value more suited to your needs. For example, if the font size is 12 pt, select line spacing of Exactly 13 pt. This will give a tighter line spacing. You can adjust the value up or down depending on how many diacritics you need to stack.


Being a sans serif font, does it have straight quotes as well as curly ones?
  Yes, there are both. Here are the Unicode codepoints (in order) and their character names included in this font:
U+0022   QUOTATION MARK
U+0027   APOSTROPHE
U+2018   LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
U+2019   RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
U+201C   LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
U+201D   RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK


Can I use Andika Design Review in my print publication?
  Andika Design Review is released under the SIL Open Font License (see http://scripts.sil.org/OFL), which permits use for any publication, whether electronic or printed. For more answers to use questions, see the OFL-FAQ (http://scripts.sil.org/OFL-FAQ). The license, along with information specific to Andika Design Review, is in the release package.


Can I use Andika Design Review on my website?
  It's very early in the production process for this font. You can certainly create web pages that request that Andika Design Review be used to display them (if that font is available on the user's system). According to the license, you are even allowed to place the font on your site for people to download it. We would strongly recommend, however, that you direct users to our site -- http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_download -- to download the font. This ensures that they are always using the most recent version with bug fixes, etc.


Can I make changes to Andika Design Review?
  Yes! That is allowed as long as you abide by the conditions of the SIL Open Font License (http://scripts.sil.org/OFL). And we would be very interested in seeing any changes you might make.


How do I give feedback?
  Go to http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_feedback and fill out the online form. And thanks in advance for doing so!  :-)  Additionally, you may wish to join the discussion forum at http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_MailingLists.
