<p>When you run this application, you will immediately see the Bible text. Press the <strong>button</strong> below that is showing the verse address, like <kbd>Genesis 1</kbd>, to go to other parts of the Bible. Press the left and right button to move to the previous and next chapters.</p>
<p>Note: Some of the verses, especially in the book of Psalms, has numberings that differ between different translations and other translations (e.g. KJV). The chapter and verse numbers of the specific translation are written in parentheses.</p>

<h2><a name="berpindah"></a>Moving to Other Parts of the Bible</h2>
<p>To move to another part of the Bible, you can press the <strong>verse address button</strong>, like <kbd>Genesis 1</kbd></p>
<p>Hold (long-press) the <strong>verse address button</strong> to open the list of recent verses.</p>

<p>On the <b>Direct</b> tab, you can directly type the <strong>verse address</strong>. How to write the <strong>verse address</strong> is: Write the first 3 or so characters of the book name, then the chapter number, then a space or a colon, then the verse number. For example <span class="kod">Luk 3:11</span> or <span class="kod">1Pe 2:5</span> (1 Peter 2:5).</p>
<p>However, <em>for your convenience</em>, you can also write it in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Type just the <strong>chapter number</strong> to go to the chapter on the same book. Example: <span class="kod">8</span></li>
	<li>Type the <strong>chapter number</strong> followed by the <strong>verse number</strong>. Example: <span class="kod">3 16</span>, <span class="kod">12:4</span></li>
	<li>Type the <strong>book name</strong> <em>just enough</em>. Example: <span class="kod">songs</span> (Song of Solomon), <span class="kod">1k</span> (1 Kings), <span class="kod">ps</span> (Psalms)</li>
	<li>Concatenate the <strong>book name</strong> and the <strong>chapter number</strong>: <span class="kod">Joh3</span>, <span class="kod">Gen48</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="referensi"></a>Cross Reference Verse</h2>
<p>In Bahasa Indonesia Terjemahan Baru version, in some verses, it provides cross reference to other related verses. The verse with cross reference provided is displayed with &#x203B. For example Genesis 1 verse 3:</p>
<blockquote>
    <sup>3</sup> Berfirmanlah Allah: "Jadilah terang." Lalu terang itu jadi. &#x203B
</blockquote>
<p>If this symbol &#x203B is tapped, cross reference verses will be displayed.</p>

<h2><a name="marka"></a>Markers</h2>
<p>Press MENU and select <strong>Markers</strong> to show all markers that you have created. There are 3 types of marker to be listed:
<blockquote>

A label can be made by clicking <kbd>Add...</kbd> when you create a bookmark and then select <strong>Create label</strong>. Label is useful if you want to put your bookmarks into categories.</li>
    <li>Notes. This feature helps you to put a note related to the verse where it attached.</li>

Press <strong>Export</strong> to send markers via email, Dropbox, bluetooth, etc (depends on apps you have installed in your device) in html format to other device. It is not for backup purpose, but to help you summarize all your markers in readable format.</p>

<h2><a name="cari"></a>Search</h2>
<p>You can find verses that contain certain words. Press the <strong>search button</strong> (with the magnifying glass symbol). </p>
<p>When the search screen opens, type the words that want to look for and click the button. The verses that contain <em>all</em> the words you entered will be displayed. For example, if you type <span class="kod">god son</span>, then even Genesis 4:25 would be displayed because it contains verses the word &quot;god&quot; and &quot;son&quot;, although not contiguous. If you type <span class="kod">just</span>, you will also find &quot;justice&quot;, &quot;justify&quot;, etc. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Use quotes to search for exact phrases. For example, <span class="kod">&quot;our father&quot;</span>.</li>
	<li>Use plus sign (+) exactly before a word to search a whole word. For example, <span class="kod">+eve</span> will find the exact word "eve" or "Eve" but not "eventually" or "evening".</li>
