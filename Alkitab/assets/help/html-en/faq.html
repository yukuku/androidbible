<body class='faq'>
<p class='q'>How do I get the NIV, ESV, NKJV, or other translations of the Bible?</p>

<p class='a'>We did not include these versions because they are not free (as in liberty) or free (as in gratis), so we can not include it in this application. You can read it in, for example, <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com'>www.biblegateway.com</a> for those versions if you want to consult them.</p>

<p class='q'>How do I search for a word like "word" without getting results containing other terms such as "sword" or "words"?</p>

<p class='a'>In order to find an exact word without affixes or other words that are not expected, add a plus sign (+) immediately before the word. For example: <tt>+word</tt>.</p>
