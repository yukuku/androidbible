For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:

And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?

But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

@@For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to @9give@7 the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;

Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.

@@Therefore, as ye abound in every @9thing, in@7 faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and @9in@7 all diligence, and @9in@7 your love to us, @9see@7 that ye abound in this grace also.
I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
@@And herein I give @9my@7 advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
@@Now therefore perform the doing @9of it;@7 that as @9there was@7 a readiness to will, so @9there may be@7 a performance also out of that which ye have.
@@For if there be first a willing mind, @9it is@7 accepted according to that a man hath, @9and@7 not according to that he hath not.

And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;
@@And not @9that@7 only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and @9declaration of@7 your ready mind:
Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:

For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.
Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
@@Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as @9a matter of@7 bounty, and not as @9of@7 covetousness.
@@But this @9I say,@7 He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

@@Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection into the gospel of Christ, and for @9your@7 liberal distribution unto them, and unto all @9men; @7

@@I desired Titus, and with @9him@7 I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? @9walked we@7 not in the same steps?
@@Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but @9we do@7 all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
@@For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and @9that@7 I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest @9there be@7 debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
@@@9And@7 lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and @9that@7 I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
@@This @9is@7 the third @9time@7 I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
@@For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, @9even@7 your perfection.
Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
Greet one another with an holy kiss.
All the saints salute you.
@@The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, @9be@7 with you all. Amen.
