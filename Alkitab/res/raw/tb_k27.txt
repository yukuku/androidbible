In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
@@And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring @9certain@7 of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;
@@Children in whom @9was@7 no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as @9had@7 ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
@@Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel @9the name@7 of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.
But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
@@And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which @9are@7 of your sort? then shall ye make @9me@7 endanger my head to the king.
Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.
Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.
As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
@@And in all matters of wisdom @9and@7 understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians @9and@7 astrologers that @9were@7 in all his realm.
@@And Daniel continued @9even@7 unto the first year of king Cyrus.
And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.
Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
@@But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, @9there is but@7 one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.

@@And @9it is@7 a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
@@For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise @9men@7 of Babylon.
@@And the decree went forth that the wise @9men@7 should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

@@That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise @9men@7 of Babylon.
Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:
@@He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what @9is@7 in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.
@@The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth @9it is,@7 that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal this secret.

Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.

My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.
@@And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast @9them@7 into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.

@@In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, @9and@7 told the sum of the matters.
Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.
And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
@@The first @9was@7 like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
@@And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and @9it had@7 three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
@@After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it @9was@7 diverse from all the beasts that @9were@7 before it; and it had ten horns.
@@I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn @9were@7 eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.
@@I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment @9was@7 white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne @9was like@7 the fiery flame, @9and@7 his wheels @9as@7 burning fire.
A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
@@I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld @9even@7 till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
@@I saw in the night visions, and, behold, @9one@7 like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.

@@I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of @9my@7 body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
@@These great beasts, which are four, @9are@7 four kings, @9which@7 shall arise out of the earth.
But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
@@Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth @9were of@7 iron, and his nails @9of@7 brass; @9which@7 devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;

I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
@@And the ten horns out of this kingdom @9are@7 ten kings @9that@7 shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
@@And he shall speak @9great@7 words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.

@@Hitherto @9is@7 the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

@@Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had @9two@7 horns: and the @9two@7 horns @9were@7 high; but one @9was@7 higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
@@I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither @9was there any@7 that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
@@And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat @9had@7 a notable horn between his eyes.
@@And he came to the ram that had @9two@7 horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
@@And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant @9land. @7
@@And it waxed great, @9even@7 to the host of heaven; and it cast down @9some@7 of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
@@Yea, he magnified @9himself@7 even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily @9sacrifice@7 was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
@@And an host was given @9him@7 against the daily @9sacrifice@7 by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.

@@So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end @9shall be@7 the vision.

In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:

@@Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that @9is@7 written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.

@@As @9it is@7 written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
@@Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God @9is@7 righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.

@@O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people @9are become@7 a reproach to all @9that are@7 about us.
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.
