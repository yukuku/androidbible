So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.
And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.

And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:
But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
@@He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I @9will be@7 his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.
Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.
Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
@@Moreover @9there are@7 workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.
@@Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, @9there is@7 no number. Arise @9therefore,@7 and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.
@@David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, @9saying, @7
@@@9Is@7 not the LORD your God with you? and hath he @9not@7 given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.
Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.
So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.

Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:

@@Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed @9be@7 thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
@@Thine, O LORD, @9is@7 the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all @9that is@7 in the heaven and in the earth @9is thine;@7 thine @9is@7 the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.
@@Both riches and honour @9come@7 of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand @9is@7 power and might; and in thine hand @9it is@7 to make great, and to give strength unto all.
Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
@@But who @9am@7 I, and what @9is@7 my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things @9come@7 of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
@@For we @9are@7 strangers before thee, and sojourners, as @9were@7 all our fathers: our days on the earth @9are@7 as a shadow, and @9there is@7 none abiding.
@@O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name @9cometh@7 of thine hand, and @9is@7 all thine own.
I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.
O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:
@@And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all @9these things,@7 and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.
And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.
@@And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, @9even@7 a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, @9and@7 a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:
@@And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed @9him@7 unto the LORD @9to be@7 the chief governor, and Zadok @9to be@7 priest.
Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.
@@And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him @9such@7 royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
@@And the time that he reigned over Israel @9was@7 forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three @9years@7 reigned he in Jerusalem.
And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
@@Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they @9are@7 written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
