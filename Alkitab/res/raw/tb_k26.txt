@@And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness @9was@7 about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.

And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
@@And their feet @9were@7 straight feet; and the sole of their feet @9was@7 like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
@@And @9they had@7 the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
@@Their wings @9were@7 joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.

@@Thus @9were@7 their faces: and their wings @9were@7 stretched upward; two @9wings@7 of every one @9were@7 joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
@@And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; @9and@7 they turned not when they went.

@@Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither @9was their@7 spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature @9was@7 in the wheels.

@@And under the firmament @9were@7 their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.

@@And there was a voice from the firmament that @9was@7 over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.

@@As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so @9was@7 the appearance of the brightness round about. This @9was@7 the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw @9it,@7 I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.
And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.
@@And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, @9even@7 unto this very day.

@@And when I looked, behold, an hand @9was@7 sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book @9was@7 therein;

@@And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat @9it;@7 and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

@@For thou @9art@7 not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, @9but@7 to the house of Israel;

@@But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel @9are@7 impudent and hardhearted.

Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.
Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.
