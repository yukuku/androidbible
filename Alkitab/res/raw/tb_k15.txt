@@I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, @9and@7 of gold an hundred talents;
Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
@@And I said unto them, Ye @9are@7 holy unto the LORD; the vessels @9are@7 holy also; and the silver and the gold @9are@7 a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.
@@Watch ye, and keep @9them,@7 until ye weigh @9them@7 before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.
@@So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring @9them@7 to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
@@Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth @9day@7 of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
@@Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him @9was@7 Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them @9was@7 Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
@@By number @9and@7 by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
@@@9Also@7 the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats @9for@7 a sin offering: all @9this was@7 a burnt offering unto the LORD.
And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.
@@Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, @9doing@7 according to their abominations, @9even@7 of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
@@For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of @9those@7 lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.
Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.
And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God.
@@And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over @9our@7 head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.
@@Since the days of our fathers @9have@7 we @9been@7 in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and @9our@7 priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as @9it is@7 this day.
@@And now for a little space grace hath been @9shewed@7 from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
@@For we @9were@7 bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
@@Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave @9it@7 for an inheritance to your children for ever.
@@And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities @9deserve,@7 and hast given us @9such@7 deliverance as this;
@@Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed @9us,@7 so that @9there should be@7 no remnant nor escaping?
@@O LORD God of Israel, thou @9art@7 righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as @9it is@7 this day: behold, we @9are@7 before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.
Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.
@@And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, @9one@7 of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
@@Arise; for @9this@7 matter @9belongeth@7 unto thee: we also @9will be@7 with thee: be of good courage, and do @9it. @7
Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.
@@Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and @9when@7 he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
@@Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It @9was@7 the ninth month, on the twentieth @9day@7 of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of @9this@7 matter, and for the great rain.
And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.
Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.
Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.
@@But the people @9are@7 many, and @9it is@7 a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither @9is this@7 a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
@@Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this @9matter:@7 and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
@@And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, @9with@7 certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by @9their@7 names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
@@And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: @9namely,@7 of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
