@@That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and @9certain@7 men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

@@And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned @9certain@7 days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,

Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
@@Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, @9If@7 ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:

@@Now these @9are@7 thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.

And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.
And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;

But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
@@Now Tobiah the Ammonite @9was@7 by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.

@@And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked @9thee@7 to anger before the builders.
So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
@@But it came to pass, @9that@7 when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, @9and@7 that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
@@And conspired all of them together to come @9and@7 to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
@@And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and @9there is@7 much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
@@And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us @9they will be upon you.@7
@@Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, @9and@7 on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.
@@And it came to pass from that time forth, @9that@7 the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers @9were@7 behind all the house of Judah.
@@They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, @9every one@7 with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other @9hand@7 held a weapon.
@@For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and @9so@7 builded. And he that sounded the trumpet @9was@7 by me.
@@And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work @9is@7 great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
@@In what place @9therefore@7 ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.
So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.
@@So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, @9saving that@7 every one put them off for washing.
And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
@@For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, @9are@7 many: therefore we take up corn @9for them,@7 that we may eat, and live.
@@@9Some@7 also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
@@There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, @9and that upon@7 our lands and vineyards.

And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
@@And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing @9to answer. @7
@@Also I said, It @9is@7 not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
@@I likewise, @9and@7 my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
@@Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the the hundredth @9part@7 of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
@@Then said they, We will restore @9them,@7 and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.
Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.
@@Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, @9that is,@7 twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
@@But the former governors that @9had been@7 before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
@@Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants @9were@7 gathered thither unto the work.
@@Moreover @9there were@7 at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that @9are@7 about us.
@@Now @9that@7 which was prepared @9for me@7 daily @9was@7 one ox @9and@7 six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
@@Think upon me, my God, for good, @9according@7 to all that I have done for this people.
@@Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and @9that@7 there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)

@@And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I @9am@7 doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
@@Wherein @9was@7 written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith @9it, that@7 thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
@@And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, @9There is@7 a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
@@For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, @9O God,@7 strengthen my hands.
@@Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who @9was@7 shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
@@And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who @9is there,@7 that, @9being@7 as I @9am,@7 would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
@@Therefore @9was@7 he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and @9that@7 they might have @9matter@7 for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
@@So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth @9day@7 of @9the month@7 Elul, in fifty and two days.
@@And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard @9thereof,@7 and all the heathen that @9were@7 about us saw @9these things,@7 they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
@@Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and @9the letters@7 of Tobiah came unto them.
@@For @9there were@7 many in Judah sworn unto him, because he @9was@7 the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
@@Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. @9And@7 Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
@@That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he @9was@7 a faithful man, and feared God above many.

And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.
And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:

Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
