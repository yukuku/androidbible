@@So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that @9was@7 at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.

Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
@@Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, @9that is so@7 great?

Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:

Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.

Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,

And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.

And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
@@And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon @9were of@7 gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon @9were of@7 pure gold: none @9were of@7 silver; it was @9not@7 any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
@@And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that @9are@7 in the low plains in abundance.
And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
@@Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, @9are@7 they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.
@@And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who @9was@7 in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard @9it,@7 that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,
Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
@@And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye @9me@7 to return answer to this people?
And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?
@@And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou @9it@7 somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little @9finger@7 shall be thicker than my father's loins.
@@For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I @9will chastise you@7 with scorpions.
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
@@And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I @9will chastise you@7 with scorpions.
So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
@@And when all Israel @9saw@7 that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and @9we have@7 none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: @9and@7 now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
@@But @9as for@7 the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
@@Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that @9was@7 over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to @9his@7 chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
@@And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen @9men,@7 which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.
He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,
And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
@@And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which @9are@7 in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.
And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
@@And in every several city @9he put@7 shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
@@And the priests and the Levites that @9were@7 in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.
For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:
And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
@@And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, @9and@7 Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)
@@And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for @9he thought@7 to make him king.
And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.
And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
@@And it came to pass, @9that@7 in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
@@With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people @9were@7 without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
@@And he took the fenced cities which @9pertained@7 to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
@@Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and @9to@7 the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
@@Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD @9is@7 righteous.
@@And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; @9therefore@7 I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
@@Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed @9them@7 to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
@@And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not destroy @9him@7 altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
@@So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam @9was@7 one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name @9was@7 Naamah an Ammonitess.
And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
@@Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, @9are@7 they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And @9there were@7 wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
@@He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also @9was@7 Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
@@And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, @9even@7 four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, @9being@7 mighty men of valour.
@@And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which @9is@7 in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
@@Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, @9even@7 to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.
@@And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye @9be@7 a great multitude, and @9there are@7 with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
@@Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of @9other@7 lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, @9the same@7 may be a priest of @9them that are@7 no gods.
@@But as for us, the LORD @9is@7 our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, @9are@7 the sons of Aaron, and the Levites @9wait@7 upon @9their@7 business:
@@And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also @9set they in order@7 upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
@@And, behold, God himself is with us for @9our@7 captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
@@But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment @9was@7 behind them.
@@And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle @9was@7 before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
@@And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, @9are@7 written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
@@And Asa did @9that which was@7 good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
@@For he took away the altars of the strange @9gods,@7 and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
@@Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about @9them@7 walls, and towers, gates, and bars, @9while@7 the land @9is@7 yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought @9him,@7 and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
@@And Asa had an army @9of men@7 that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these @9were@7 mighty men of valour.
And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
@@And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, @9it is@7 nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou @9art@7 our God; let not man prevail against thee.
So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
@@And Asa and the people that @9were@7 with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
@@And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD @9is@7 with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
@@Now for a long season Israel @9hath been@7 without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
@@And in those times @9there was@7 no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations @9were@7 upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.
Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.
@@And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that @9was@7 before the porch of the LORD.
@@And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God @9was@7 with him.
So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
@@And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil @9which@7 they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.
@@And also @9concerning@7 Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from @9being@7 queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped @9it,@7 and burnt @9it@7 at the brook Kidron.
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
@@And there was no @9more@7 war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
@@@9There is@7 a league between me and thee, as @9there was@7 between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
And Ben- hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
@@And it came to pass, when Baasha heard @9it,@7 that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.
@@For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of @9them@7 whose heart @9is@7 perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
@@Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for @9he was@7 in a rage with him because of this @9thing.@7 And Asa oppressed @9some@7 of the people the same time.
@@And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they @9are@7 written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
@@And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease @9was@7 exceeding @9great:@7 yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.
And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
@@And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds @9of spices@7 prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.
And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.
And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;
@@But sought to the @9LORD@7 God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.

@@Also @9some@7 of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.

@@And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, @9were@7 in Jerusalem.

And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
@@Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return @9therefore@7 every man to his house in peace.
@@And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee @9that@7 he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
@@Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and @9on@7 his left.

Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?
@@And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And @9the LORD@7 said, Thou shalt entice @9him,@7 and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do @9even@7 so.

So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.

Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.
And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.

And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.

Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.
He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.
And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.

So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.
But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.

And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.
So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people.
Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

@@Jotham @9was@7 twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also @9was@7 Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
@@And he did @9that which was@7 right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.
He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.
So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.
@@Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they @9are@7 written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
@@Ahaz @9was@7 twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not @9that which was@7 right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:
For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
@@Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought @9them@7 to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
@@For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, @9which were@7 all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
@@And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah @9that was@7 next to the king.
And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
@@But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name @9was@7 Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage @9that@7 reacheth up unto heaven.
@@And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: @9but are there@7 not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?
@@Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD @9is@7 upon you.
Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
@@And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD @9already,@7 ye intend to add @9more@7 to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and @9there is@7 fierce wrath against Israel.
So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.
For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.
And Tilgath- pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
@@For Ahaz took away a portion @9out@7 of the house of the LORD, and @9out@7 of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave @9it@7 unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
@@And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this @9is that@7 king Ahaz.
@@For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, @9therefore@7 will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.
@@Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they @9are@7 written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
@@And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, @9even@7 in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

@@And he did @9that which was@7 right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.
And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,
@@And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy @9place. @7

@@Now @9it is@7 in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
@@And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse @9it,@7 and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took @9it,@7 to carry @9it@7 out abroad into the brook Kidron.
@@Now they began on the first @9day@7 of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.
@@Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they @9are@7 before the altar of the LORD.
Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
@@And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer @9them@7 on the altar of the LORD.

@@And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for @9so was@7 the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.

@@And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began @9also@7 with the trumpets, and with the instruments @9ordained@7 by David king of Israel.
@@And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: @9and@7 all @9this continued@7 until the burnt offering was finished.
And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.
@@And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, @9and@7 two hundred lambs: all these @9were@7 for a burnt offering to the LORD.
@@And the consecrated things @9were@7 six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
@@But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the @9other@7 priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites @9were@7 more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
@@And also the burnt offerings @9were@7 in abundance,with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for @9every@7 burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
@@And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was @9done@7 suddenly.
And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.
For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
@@So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done @9it@7 of a long @9time in such sort@7 as it was written.
So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
@@And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, @9who@7 therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
@@Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers @9were, but@7 yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.

So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.
And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
@@And they arose and took away the altars that @9were@7 in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast @9them@7 into the brook Kidron.

@@And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, @9singing@7 with loud instruments unto the LORD.
And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.
@@And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept @9other@7 seven days with gladness.
For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
@@So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel @9there was@7 not the like in Jerusalem.
@@Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came @9up@7 to his holy dwelling place, @9even@7 unto heaven.

Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.
@@@9He appointed@7 also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, @9to wit,@7 for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as @9it is@7 written in the law of the LORD.
Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.
@@And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all @9things@7 brought they in abundantly.

Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.

@@And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that @9were@7 on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust @9of them,@7 and strowed @9it@7 upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.
And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
@@And @9so did he@7 in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.
And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
@@And they put @9it@7 in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:
@@Even to the artificers and builders gave they @9it,@7 to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
@@And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them @9were@7 Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set @9it@7 forward; and @9other of@7 the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.
@@Also @9they were@7 over the bearers of burdens, and @9were@7 overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites @9there were@7 scribes, and officers, and porters.
@@And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD @9given@7 by Moses.
And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
@@And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do @9it. @7
And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.
Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,
@@Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great @9is@7 the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.
@@And Hilkiah, and @9they@7 that the king @9had appointed,@7 went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that @9effect.@7
And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,
@@Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, @9even@7 all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:
Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
@@And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel @9concerning@7 the words which thou hast heard;
@@Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard @9thee@7 also, saith the LORD.
Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.
And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.
@@And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand @9to it.@7 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
@@And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that @9pertained@7 to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, @9even@7 to serve the LORD their God. @9And@7 all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
@@Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth @9day@7 of the first month.
And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,
@@And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; @9it shall@7 not @9be@7 a burden upon @9your@7 shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,
@@And prepare @9yourselves@7 by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
@@And stand in the holy @9place@7 according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and @9after@7 the division of the families of the Levites.
@@So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that @9they@7 may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
@@And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these @9were@7 of the king's substance.
@@And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred @9small cattle,@7 and three hundred oxen.
@@Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand @9small cattle,@7 and five hundred oxen.
So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.
@@And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled @9the blood@7 from their hands, and the Levites flayed @9them. @7
@@And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as @9it is@7 written in the book of Moses. And so @9did they@7 with the oxen.
@@And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the @9other@7 holy @9offerings@7 sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided @9them@7 speedily among all the people.
@@And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron @9were busied@7 in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
@@And the singers the sons of Asaph @9were@7 in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters @9waited@7 at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
@@But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? @9I come@7 not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from @9meddling with@7 God, who @9is@7 with me, that he destroy thee not.
Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
@@His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in @9one of@7 the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
@@And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they @9are@7 written in the lamentations.
@@Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to @9that which was@7 written in the law of the LORD,
@@And his deeds, first and last, behold, they @9are@7 written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
@@Jehoahaz @9was@7 twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
@@Jehoiakim @9was@7 twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did @9that which was@7 evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
@@Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they @9are@7 written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
@@Zedekiah @9was@7 one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
@@And he did @9that which was@7 evil in the sight of the LORD his God, @9and@7 humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet @9speaking@7 from the mouth of the LORD.
And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.
Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
@@But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till @9there was@7 no remedy.
@@Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave @9them@7 all into his hand.

And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
