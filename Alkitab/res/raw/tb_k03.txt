@@@9And@7 when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver @9you@7 your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
@@Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; @9even@7 then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
@@And upon them that are left @9alive@7 of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
@@And @9that@7 I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
@@And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I @9am@7 the LORD their God.
@@But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I @9am@7 the LORD.
@@These @9are@7 the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
@@Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons @9shall be@7 for the LORD by thy estimation.
And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
@@And if it @9be@7 a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
@@And if @9it be@7 from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
@@And if @9it be@7 from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation @9shall be@7 three shekels of silver.
@@And if @9it be@7 from sixty years old and above; if @9it be@7 a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
@@And if @9it be@7 a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that @9any man@7 giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
@@And if @9it be@7 any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
@@And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, @9who art@7 the priest, so shall it be.
@@But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth @9part@7 thereof unto thy estimation.
@@And when a man shall sanctify his house @9to be@7 holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
@@And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth @9part@7 of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
@@And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD @9some part@7 of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed @9shall be valued@7 at fifty shekels of silver.
If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
@@And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth @9part@7 of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
@@And if @9a man@7 sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which @9is@7 not of the fields of his possession;
@@Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, @9even@7 unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, @9as@7 a holy thing unto the LORD.
@@In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, @9even@7 to him to whom the possession of the land @9did belong. @7
And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
@@Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether @9it be@7 ox, or sheep: it @9is@7 the LORD'S.
@@And if @9it be@7 of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth @9part@7 of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
@@Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, @9both@7 of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing @9is@7 most holy unto the LORD.
@@None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; @9but@7 shall surely be put to death.
@@And all the tithe of the land, @9whether@7 of the seed of the land, @9or@7 of the fruit of the tree, @9is@7 the LORD'S: @9it is@7 holy unto the LORD.
@@And if a man will at all redeem @9ought@7 of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth @9part@7 thereof.
@@And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, @9even@7 of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.
He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
