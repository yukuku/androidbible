Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
@@And he had two wives; the name of the one @9was@7 Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
@@And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, @9were@7 there.
And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.
And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.
@@And @9as@7 he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
@@Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? @9am@7 not I better to thee than ten sons?
So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
@@And she @9was@7 in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.
And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.
Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
@@And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I @9am@7 a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
@@Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant @9thee@7 thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
@@And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more @9sad.@7
And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
@@Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, @9saying,@7 Because I have asked him of the LORD.
And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
@@But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, @9I will not go up@7 until the child be weaned, and @9then@7 I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
@@And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child @9was@7 young.
And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
@@And she said, Oh my lord, @9as@7 thy soul liveth, my lord, I @9am@7 the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.
For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.
And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
@@@9There is@7 none holy as the LORD: for @9there is@7 none beside thee: neither @9is there@7 any rock like our God.
@@Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let @9not@7 arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
@@The bows of the mighty men @9are@7 broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
@@@9They that were@7 full have hired out themselves for bread; and @9they that were@7 hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
@@He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, @9and@7 lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set @9them@7 among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth @9are@7 the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.
He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
@@Now the sons of Eli @9were@7 sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
@@And the priests' custom with the people @9was, that,@7 when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
@@And he struck @9it@7 into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
@@And @9if@7 any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and @9then@7 take @9as much@7 as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, @9Nay;@7 but thou shalt give @9it me@7 now: and if not, I will take @9it@7 by force.
Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
@@But Samuel ministered before the LORD, @9being@7 a child, girded with a linen ephod.
@@Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought @9it@7 to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.
And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
@@Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled @9at@7 the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
@@Nay, my sons; for @9it is@7 no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.
If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.
And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
@@And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel @9to be@7 my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

@@And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; @9there was@7 no open vision.

@@And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here @9am@7 I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.
@@And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here @9am@7 I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
@@In that day I will perform against Eli all @9things@7 which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.

And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
@@Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here @9am@7 I.

And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
@@So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth @9between@7 the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, @9were@7 there with the ark of the covenant of God.
And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
@@And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What @9meaneth@7 the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.
And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
@@Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these @9are@7 the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
@@And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told @9it,@7 all the city cried out.

And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
@@And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, @9near@7 to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
@@And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard @9it. @7

And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.
And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

@@And it was @9so,@7 that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.
Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.
And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
@@Then said they, What @9shall be@7 the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, @9according to@7 the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

@@And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he @9is@7 not a man, that he should repent.
@@Then he said, I have sinned: @9yet@7 honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.
So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
@@And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear @9it,@7 he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.
@@And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me @9him@7 whom I name unto thee.
And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
@@And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed @9is@7 before him.
@@But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for @9the LORD seeth@7 not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.
@@And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all @9thy@7 children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.
@@And he sent, and brought him in. Now he @9was@7 ruddy, @9and@7 withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this @9is@7 he.
Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
@@Let our lord now command thy servants, @9which are@7 before thee, to seek out a man, @9who is@7 a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.

@@Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which @9is@7 with the sheep.
@@And Jesse took an ass @9laden@7 with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent @9them@7 by David his son unto Saul.

@@And it came to pass, when the @9evil@7 spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
@@Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which @9belongeth@7 to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
@@Now David @9was@7 the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name @9was@7 Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men @9for@7 an old man in the days of Saul.

For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
@@And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard @9them. @7
And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
@@And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, @9that@7 the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.

And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
@@And David said, What have I now done? @9Is there@7 not a cause?

David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.
And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
@@And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved @9it.@7 And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved @9them.@7 And David put them off him.

And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
@@And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle @9is@7 the LORD'S, and he will give you into our hands.

@@And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang @9it,@7 and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.

Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
@@And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son @9is@7 this youth? And Abner said, @9As@7 thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.
Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.

But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.

@@Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow @9shalt@7 thou and thy sons @9be@7 with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
@@And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded @9it,@7 and did bake unleavened bread thereof:

@@Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which @9is@7 in Jezreel.
And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.
@@Then said the princes of the Philistines, What @9do@7 these Hebrews @9here?@7 And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, @9Is@7 not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell @9unto me@7 unto this day?
@@And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? @9should it@7 not @9be@7 with the heads of these men?
@@@9Is@7 not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
@@Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, @9as@7 the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host @9is@7 good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.
Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
@@And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou @9art@7 good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
@@And had taken the women captives, that @9were@7 therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried @9them@7 away, and went on their way.

@@Then David and the people that @9were@7 with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
@@And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake @9them,@7 and without fail recover @9all. @7
@@So David went, he and the six hundred men that @9were@7 with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;
@@And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk @9any@7 water, three days and three nights.

@@And when he had brought him down, behold, @9they were@7 spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
@@And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any @9thing@7 that they had taken to them: David recovered all.

Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.
And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
@@And when the men of Israel that @9were@7 on the other side of the valley, and @9they@7 that @9were@7 on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
@@And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish @9it in@7 the house of their idols, and among the people.

And when the inhabitants of  Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
