Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
@@It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and @9so@7 it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
@@And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here @9am@7 I.
@@And he said unto me, Who @9art@7 thou? And I answered him, I @9am@7 an Amalekite.
@@He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life @9is@7 yet whole in me.
@@So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that @9was@7 upon his head, and the bracelet that @9was@7 on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
@@Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that @9were@7 with him:
And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
@@And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence @9art@7 thou? And he answered, I @9am@7 the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?
@@And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, @9and@7 fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
@@And David said unto him, Thy blood @9be@7 upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
@@(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah @9the use of@7 the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
@@Saul and Jonathan @9were@7 lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.

I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.

And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.
So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.
@@And his men that @9were@7 with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
@@Ishbosheth Saul's son @9was@7 forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
@@Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which @9pertained@7 to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.

@@And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel @9was as@7 light of foot as a wild roe.

And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
@@Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth @9rib,@7 that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, @9that@7 as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
@@Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that @9lieth@7 before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.
Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
@@And Joab said, @9As@7 God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.
@@But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, @9so that@7 three hundred and threescore men died.
@@And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which @9was in@7 Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.
Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
@@And Saul had a concubine, whose name @9was@7 Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and @9Ishbosheth@7 said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?

So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;
To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.

@@And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose @9is@7 the land? saying @9also,@7 Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand @9shall be@7 with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.

@@And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver @9me@7 my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
@@So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that @9were@7 with him a feast.
And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
@@And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from @9pursuing@7 a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner @9was@7 not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.

@@And David said to Joab, and to all the people that @9were@7 with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David @9himself@7 followed the bier.

@@Thy hands @9were@7 not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, @9so@7 fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.

@@And all the people took notice @9of it,@7 and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

@@And I @9am@7 this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah @9be@7 too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.
And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
@@And Saul's son had two men @9that were@7 captains of bands: the name of the one @9was@7 Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:

@@David @9was@7 thirty years old when he began to reign, @9and@7 he reigned forty years.

And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.

And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?
So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.
And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
